# MarsRover

Technology used was .Net Core 3.1, C#, JavaScript/jQuery and Bootstrap style framework and created with Visual Studio Enterprise 2019.

This application is using MVC style application design even though I am not utilizing models within the views. There is an ApiController (RoverConroller) that is acting as the Rover tranmission that will recieve and response with updated coorinates.

Validation is handled via regex patterns during submission even though originally started it using data-annotations but because of adding in multiple rover submissions, I changed the logic and wished that I had started with my first design which was (React).

Regrets, due to the amount of time, I did not get the chance to implment the logging I would have liked, Unit testing as well as better coordinate and movement conrtrol class. I also was not able to finish the database storage that I had originally planned on.
